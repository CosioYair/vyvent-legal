/**
 * Shared definitions for the DEV ↔ PROD web promotion workflow.
 *
 * Two separate Git repositories serve the same Orbiventt website against two
 * different Supabase projects:
 *
 *   CosioYair/vyvent-legal     DEV   GitHub Pages project site   Supabase DEV
 *   CosioYair/orbiventt-legal  PROD  https://orbiventt.com       Supabase PROD
 *
 * SOURCE-OF-TRUTH RULE
 *   `orbiventt-legal` is the canonical PRODUCTION codebase.
 *   `vyvent-legal` is the DEV mirror and the implementation surface: features
 *   are written and validated here first, then PROMOTED — copied, never
 *   rewritten — into the production repository at the approved release gate.
 *
 * Everything below exists so that "the same implementation" is a mechanically
 * checkable claim rather than a habit.
