/**
 * Shared definitions for the DEV ↔ PROD web promotion workflow.
 *
 * Two separate Git repositories serve the same Orbiventt website against two
 * different Supabase projects:
 *
 *   CosioYair/vyvent-legal     DEV   GitHub Pages project site   Supabase DEV
 *   CosioYair/orbiventt-legal  PROD  https://orbiventt.com       Supabase PROD
 *
 * SOURCE-OF-TRUTH RULE
 *   `orbiventt-legal` is the canonical PRODUCTION codebase.
 *   `vyvent-legal` is the DEV mirror and the implementation surface: features
 *   are written and validated here first, then PROMOTED — copied, never
 *   rewritten — into the production repository at the approved release gate.
 *
 * Everything below exists so that "the same implementation" is a mechanically
 * checkable claim rather than a habit.

/**
 * THE WEB BUILD VERSION — the one canonical cache key for the executable
 * invitation module graph.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS (2026-08-18 incident, second wave). GitHub Pages serves every
 * JS file with `Cache-Control: max-age=14400` and the HTML document with 600.
 * ES import specifiers are resolved without query strings, so versioning ONE
 * module changed nothing for a browser that still held the PARENT modules: its
 * cached `main.js` → `passes.js` graph predated the smart CTA, never read
 * `__ORB_APP_LINKS__` at all, and kept rendering the raw `vyvent://` anchor
 * for up to four hours — Chrome on a returning guest's phone, in production.
 *
 * THE RULE. Every executable edge of the invitation graph — the HTML's script
 * tags and every static and dynamic relative `.js` import under `invitation/`
 * — carries `?v=` + this exact value. A new HTML document therefore names a
 * set of URLs the old cache has never seen and CANNOT answer: the entire new
 * graph loads together or not at all. Stale HTML keeps naming the old set,
 * which is equally coherent. There is no mixed state.
 *
 * HOW TO BUMP. Never by hand, never per-file:
 *
 *     node scripts/set-web-build.mjs 20260819a
 *
 * rewrites this constant and re-stamps every edge in one deterministic pass;
 * `--check` verifies coherence without writing (the test suite runs it). Bump
 * on ANY behavioural JS change that must reach guests faster than the 4-hour
 * cache would allow it to.
 *
 * NOT the share thumbnail's `&v=`. That value fingerprints an IMAGE for OG
 * crawlers on the invitation's public URL; this one fingerprints the CODE for
 * browsers on asset URLs. They share a letter and nothing else.
