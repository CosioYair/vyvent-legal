/* APP HANDOFF — the single decision point for "Abrir en Orbiventt".
 *
 * Every page that offers to open the app asks this module for the URL, and
 * nothing else in the site is allowed to build one. It exists because the two
 * deployments hand off to two DIFFERENT things, and the difference is not
 * cosmetic:
 *
 *   PRODUCTION (orbiventt.com)      → vyvent://<route>
 *       The installed Orbiventt build owns the `vyvent:` scheme. This is the
 *       real, permanent handoff and it is UNCHANGED by this module.
 *
 *   DEVELOPMENT (vyvent-legal)      → exp://<metro-host>:<port>/--/<route>
 *       A DEV session usually runs inside Expo Go, which does NOT own
 *       `vyvent:`. Emitting `vyvent://` here does not open the DEV project —
 *       iOS routes it straight to the INSTALLED PRODUCTION APP, which then
 *       looks up a DEV event id in the production database and finds nothing.
 *       That silent cross-environment jump is the bug this module removes.
 *
 * The DEV target cannot be a constant: the Metro host is the developer's LAN
 * address (or a tunnel host) and changes per machine, per network, per session.
 * So the app itself computes its own return URL with `Linking.createURL()` at
 * share time and attaches it to the link as `?app_return=`. This module's job
 * is to decide whether that attached URL may be trusted.
 *
 * ── The parameter is attacker-controlled ────────────────────────────────────
 * `?app_return=` arrives in a URL, so anyone who can get a visitor to open a
 * link controls it completely. Handing it to `location = …` unchecked would be
 * a textbook open redirect into arbitrary schemes. Every rule in
 * `expoGoReturnUrl()` below exists to make that impossible, and the resulting
 * href is REBUILT from validated components — the caller's string is never
 * echoed back out.
 *
 * ── Why this file is shared, not DEV-only ───────────────────────────────────
 * `scripts/web-env.mjs` keeps both deployments byte-equivalent apart from
 * `env.js`; behavior is gated on the environment that `env.js` declares, never
 * on which copy of the code is running. Same pattern as the DEV badge: the
 * markup ships everywhere, only `env.js` can reveal it. Production therefore
 * ignores `?app_return=` entirely — it is not merely unused there, it is
 * unreachable, so this DEV affordance cannot weaken the production handoff.

     *   2. It parses as an absolute URL.
     *   3. Its scheme is exactly `exp:` or `exps:`.
     *   4. It carries no embedded credentials (`exp://user:pass@host/…`), which
     *      exist only to make a hostile host look familiar.
     *   5. It has a host — Expo Go return URLs always name a Metro server. The
     *      host itself is intentionally NOT constrained: a LAN address, a
     *      localhost port and an `*.exp.direct` tunnel are all legitimate, and
     *      an allowlist here would silently break tunnel-mode development.
     *   6. It carries no query string and no fragment of its own. We append the
     *      invitation code ourselves, so anything already there is unexpected
     *      input rather than something to merge.
     *   7. Its path is EXACTLY `/--/<route>` for the route this page is
     *      rendering. This is the check that binds the return URL to the page:
     *      a link for event A can never carry a return URL that opens event B,
     *      a settings screen, or any other route.
     *
     * The href returned is assembled from the validated scheme, the validated
     * host and the route THIS PAGE computed — never from the raw input.

     * marker against its own configured origin and refuses a mismatch before
     * touching any data. A production build that receives the marked link
     * therefore rejects it outright, which is what makes emitting the shared
     * scheme here safe; a tampered or forged marker can only cause a refusal,
     * never a crossover, because each side compares only against its own
     * identity.
