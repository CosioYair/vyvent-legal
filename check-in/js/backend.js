/* THE ONLY PLACE THIS PAGE TALKS TO A SERVER.
 *
 * Two RPCs, a closed allowlist, nothing else — the same shape as
 * `invitation/js/backend.js`, for the same reason: "which endpoints can this
 * page contact" should be a list you can read, not a property you have to
 * trace through the code.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT A SECRET
 * `env.js` carries a PUBLISHABLE anon JWT (role=anon). It is meant to ship in
 * client code and it authenticates NOTHING here — it merely reaches PostgREST.
 * The authorization is the SCANNER CAPABILITY, verified inside the database
 * transaction on every call. There is deliberately NO fallback project: a
 * deployment whose env.js did not load must fail closed rather than query the
 * wrong environment.
 *
 * The browser never decides anything. It cannot read a pass, cannot tell a
 * valid capability from a forged one, and cannot know whether a code has been
 * used. It asks, and it renders the answer.
