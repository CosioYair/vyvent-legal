/* RESOLVING A STORED INVITATION — the draft and published routes.
 *
 * Extracted from `main.js` so the whole decision can be executed under
 * `node --test` with a stub RPC: which endpoint a route may contact, with which
 * parameters, and what every failure resolves to. Those are the properties that
 * matter most on this page, and asserting them against the shipped file is
 * worth more than asserting them against a description of it.
 *
 * DOM-FREE and side-effect free. It fetches, it decides, it returns a verdict;
 * drawing is `main.js`'s job.
 *
 * ── THE CALL TABLE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A closed map from route mode to the ONE request that mode may make. It is
 * data, not branching, so "what can the published route contact" is a line you
 * read rather than a path you trace — and `callRpc` in backend.js independently
 * refuses anything outside its own allowlist, so both layers would have to be
 * wrong at once.
 *
 *   draft      get_invitation_draft     { p_invitation_id, p_token }
 *   published  get_published_invitation { p_slug }
 *
 * The published request carries NO token. It cannot: publishing is what makes an
 * invitation resolvable, and a token in a link meant to be forwarded to two
 * hundred guests would be a secret that is not one.
 *
 * ── ONE FAILURE, ONE ANSWER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Unknown slug, malformed slug, a draft, an unpublished invitation, a deleted
 * one, a moderated event, a template this build does not have, a configuration
 * that will not normalize, a network error: `unavailable`, every time. A guest
 * cannot learn from this page whether a private invitation exists.
 *
 * The single exception is the ORGANIZER's own draft that is merely unfinished —
 * `incomplete` — which is not an error and is only ever reachable by someone
 * holding the unforgeable preview token for that specific invitation.
