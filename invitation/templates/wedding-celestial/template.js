/* TEMPLATE DESCRIPTOR — wedding_celestial, version 1.
 *
 * An evening wedding: midnight ground, warm ivory type and restrained antique
 * gold. THE ONLY DARK COLLECTION of the five, which makes it the only one whose
 * contrast budget runs light-on-dark — see the header of its stylesheet.
 *
 * The vocabulary is generic wedding stationery drawn from scratch: a gate arch,
 * a crescent, constellation hairlines and four-point sparks. It borrows NOTHING
 * from Orbiventt's own brand — no orbit mark, no logo, no product gradient, no
 * app-icon geometry — because this is a couple's invitation, not a promotional
 * page. A test enforces that isolation.
 *
 * A descriptor is DATA. The rendering is the shared section renderers in
 * invitation/js/sections/; a template is a palette, a stylesheet and an order.
 * Image geometry, section order and shared UI copy come from the CATEGORY
 * (../placements.js) — the very same frozen objects the other four use — so an
 * organizer switching design can never have a photograph re-cropped or moved to
 * a different part of the invitation.
 *
 * VERSIONING: `templateVersion` is part of the registry identity and is stored
 * on every invitation authored with it. A visual change that would alter an
 * already-published invitation ships as version 2 with its own directory.
