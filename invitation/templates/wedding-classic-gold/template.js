/* TEMPLATE DESCRIPTOR — wedding_classic_gold, version 1.
 *
 * Formal stationery: ivory, warm gold and a serif that behaves like engraving.
 * Where Romántica is soft and asymmetric, this one is SYMMETRICAL and ruled —
 * every section is centred inside a thin engraved frame, headings are small
 * caps over a double rule, and the ornament is drawn geometry (rings, laurel,
 * a diamond monogram) rather than a flourish.
 *
 * A descriptor is DATA. The rendering is the shared section renderers in
 * invitation/js/sections/; a template is a palette, a stylesheet and an order.
 * Image geometry, section order and shared UI copy come from the CATEGORY
 * (../placements.js), so an organizer switching design can never have a
 * photograph re-cropped or moved to a different part of the invitation.
 *
 * VERSIONING: `templateVersion` is part of the registry identity and is stored
 * on every invitation authored with it. A visual change that would alter an
 * already-published invitation ships as version 2 with its own directory.
